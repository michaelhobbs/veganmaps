<!-- map implementation attaches to the element loading this component with id='map-canvas'
  this is currently in order to preserve the css changes when opening the list view on a
  mobile device.
  putting a div here with id='map-canvas' then requires giving it height: 100% in order for the map to load correctly
  however, then when the list opens on mobile devices it is offscreen as the map does not reduce height to 0
