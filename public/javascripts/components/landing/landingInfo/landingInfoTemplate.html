//// PART 0: TOC


//// PART 1 : what this site is and how to use it
site to bring vegan serving restaurants to public's attention and allow public to share a transparent view of the restaurant
allow users to organize when and where to eat, even on hte go
// why is it so slow? we are using a free hosting service for maps and geolocation. In order to not drown them with requests the automcomplete delay is 1second. So after you stop typing we wait for 1second before asking the server for suggestions. The map is hosted for free by a third party. They do not invest a lot of money in resources. It is meant aas a showcase. As we grow we will investigate hosting the map ourselves. This will also allow us to generate maps with colours that we want.

//// PART 2 : vegan in other contexts. Delivery foods, shoes, clothes, motorbike stuff, shops, links to associations, etc
check my mails to chryssa about shoes
lilly's , sushi, flying pizza in ZH for delivery
